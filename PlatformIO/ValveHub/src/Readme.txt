To setup the Valve Hub

If you HAVE NOT setup a Leak Detctor
1) Open the 'config.h' tab
2) Change the ssid if you would like
3) Change the password, I recomend ussing a UUID generator to make it secure
4) Make a copy of the config.h file and put it in the Leak Detector folder, the config.h file is universal across devices
5) Select your ESP8266/ESP32 board
6) Click the upload button
