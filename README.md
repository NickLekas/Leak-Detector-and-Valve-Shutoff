# Leak Detector and Valve Shutoff
This is an ESP8266 based leak detection system that will close a valve when a leak is detected

This project was developed using the Visual Studio Code plugin PlatformIO, a powerful step up from the Arduino IDE. 
Becasue of this, files for both PlatformIO and the Arduio IDE are provided. If you’re using the Arduino IDE follow the instructions 
in the ino file. If you’re using PlatformIO, follow the instructions in the ‘Readme.txt’ that is in the ‘src’ folder for each device.
PlatofrmIO is setup to download all needed libraies and the Arduino IDE will need a library installed manually which is provided in the
Ardruino IDE folder.

Development used Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266 modules, an Adafruit stepper motor Feather Wing, and a stepper motor of your choice that is strong enough to turn the valve you are using.
A hookup guide is provided in the form of a word doc.
